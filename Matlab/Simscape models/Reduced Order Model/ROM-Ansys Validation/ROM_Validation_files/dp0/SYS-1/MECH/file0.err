 Unknown parameter name= L5_Y.  A value of 7.888609052E-31 will be used. 

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.109   TIME= 21:06:47
 Unknown parameter name= L5_Z.  A value of 7.888609052E-31 will be used. 

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.422   TIME= 21:06:47
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.469   TIME= 21:06:47
 MPC184 elements are being used in the current analysis and the          
 NLGEOM,ON command has not been used.  Thus, only linearized behavior    
 will be considered.  If finite rotation and large deflection effects    
 are to be considered, please use the NLGEOM,ON command.                 

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.500   TIME= 21:06:47
 Meshes made up of 10 percent or more of SOLID185 tetrahedra are not     
 recommended.                                                            

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.766   TIME= 21:06:48
 Real constant set 108 has 12 real constants defined which is more than  
 the 6 real constants used by element 141366 (LINK180).  This set may    
 have been defined for another element type.  Testing for this           
 discontinues for this model.                                            

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.953   TIME= 21:06:49
 Overconstraint may occur for Lagrange multiplier or MPC based contact   
 algorithm.                                                              

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.953   TIME= 21:06:49
 Certain contact elements (for example 141359 & 133676) overlap with     
 other.                                                                  

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.953   TIME= 21:06:49
 Certain contact pairs (for example 31 & 29) overlap with other.         

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       4.453   TIME= 21:06:50
 The sparse solver must be used if any current technology elements with  
 u-P formulation or MPC184 elements using Lagrangian multiplier          
 entangle with other contraint equtions.  The equation solver option     
 has been switched to the sparse solver.                                 

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       7.500   TIME= 21:06:53
 Pivoting has been activated for the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver .  
 The memory required may greatly exceed the predicted amount.  In that   
 event, use the DSPOPTION command to change the memory mode and/or       
 memory size used by the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver.               

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      11.203   TIME= 21:06:57
 A reference moment value times the tolerance is used by the             
 Newton-Raphson method for checking convergence.  The calculated         
 reference MOMENT CONVERGENCE VALUE = 0 is less than a threshold.  This  
 threshold is internally calculated.  You can overwrite it by            
 specifying MINREF on the CNVTOL command.  Check results carefully.
